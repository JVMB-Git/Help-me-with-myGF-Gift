# Help-me-with-myGF-Gift
I want to make a surprise for my girlfriend, but I am a begginer, most of the code is from tutorials and it (not surpring) ins't working, please help

The project should be a windows pop up with the title "ERROR:Your heart has been hacked" text "Do you want to accept"
then a yes and a no button, but the no vanishes when click on it

Then by clicking yes it would open an animation from a heart with our photos inside (Just got anything as example on the git)

I started by the heart animation since it seams harder and I can send only it if I don't get along with the pop up

I have until 10/02 cause it is our aniversary
